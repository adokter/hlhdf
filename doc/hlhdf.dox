\section whatsnew "Whats new in HL-HDF 0.7?"
\li Supporting HDF5 1.8.x. 
\li Major restructure of the APIs (See \ref migration_06_07)
\li Documentation has been written in doxygen instead to simplify maintenance.
\li Corrected potential memory leak/crash when translating to a native datatype
\li _pyhl.setScalarValue and _pyhl.setSimpleValue contained a bug in PyArg_ParseTuple that caused the provided typeidentifier to be corrupted.
\li Added a test suite that can be run after compilation. (Currently requires that HLHDF has been built with python support).
\li Added some new functions / ways to work with HLHDF to simplify some use-cases. MORE INFO TO COME HERE...
\li Since _pyhl was compiled with a libhlhdf.a, it did not share error and debug functions with other python modules. So, _pyhl is now compiled with libhlhdf.so.
\li HL_NodeList and HL_Node members are now hidden, use HL_NodeList and HL_Node functions instead.
\li Added possibility to turn on HLHDF memory debugging (with --enable-debug-memory) to get memory usage statistics and warnings.
