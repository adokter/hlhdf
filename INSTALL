The installation of HLHDF follows the traditional configure, make, make install sequence. 

Requirements:
- HDF5 library version 1.8.x or higher (http://www.hdfgroup.org/HDF5)
- gnu zip (including zlib), version 1.1.0 or higher
- gnu tar
- gnu make version 3.7x or higher (or compatible)


Configure & Build
Most of the options for the configure is probably not nessecary to specify but
if you are uncertain, then type './configure --help' to get a list of all options.

The two options that might be nessecary to specify is the installation directory and where
the HDF5 library resides.

  ./configure --prefix=<where to install HLHDF> --with-hdf5=<HDF5 include files>,<HDF5 library files>

When the configuration has successfully be done, then it is time to build the software which is done
by using 'make'.

Example:
%> ./configure --prefix=/opt/HLHDF --with-hdf5=/opt/include,/opt/lib
%> make

Test
After the software successfully has been built, it is possible to perform
a sanity test before installing the package. This is done by executing:
%> make test

Installation
Make sure that you have permissions to write files in the directory specified by the --prefix
directive during the configuration phase before typing:
%> make install
