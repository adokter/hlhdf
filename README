HL-HDF Release 0.7+

This version supports HDF5 1.8.x and is not fully backward compatible with previous releases
of HL-HDF, please refer to the migration guide in the documentation.

We have changed to use doxygen for documentation purpose so, if if you want to read the documentation
without installing the software run the script "gen_doc.sh" that resides in <HLHDF src dir>/scripts.
The documentation will be generated in <HLHDF src dir>/doxygen/doxygen/html.
You can also generate the documentation through the make-system but that requires that configure
has successfully been run.
